pylibnet - Python module for the libnet packet injection library
Copyright (C) 2009  Nadeem Douba

To install this module you will need to install the following:
	* libnet-1.1.x: to inject your packets.

All these prerequisites can be installed using apt-get, port, or fink.
Debian users can install the following packages to meet the pre-
requisite requirements:
	* build-essential
	* libnet1-dev
	* python-dev

For Mac OS/X users, please use the libnet libraries that come from
the Fink or MacPorts distribution. If you try to compile libnet in 
Mac OS/X you will run into a bug that causes "pblock not found" errors.
Mac OS/X users will have to install the following prerequisites 
in MacPorts:
  * libnet11
	* python25 (this is essential since Mac OS/X Python only runs 
              in 64-bit mode and the libnet lib is 32-bit only)

After installing python25 use the following command to make the 
MacPorts distro of Python active:

sudo python_select python25

Please let me know if we can improve this wrapper in any way. The
documentation is embedded in the library and can be accessed via
the help() function in the Python interpretter or pydoc.

Happy Injecting!
